  <h3>
    Particle Web3Modal Boilerplate
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Boilerplate for implementing Particle Auth Core (`@particle-network/auth-core-modal`) within an instance of Web3Modal using `@web3modal/ethers/react`. Materialized as a "Particle Wallet" option within the Web3Modal interface, a general social login modal is opened allowing users to login and connect using Google, Twitter, email, phone, etc.

Built using **Web3Modal**, **Typescript**, and **Particle Auth Core**.

## üîë Particle Auth Core
Particle Auth Core, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc. - as an alternative to Particle Auth, the Auth Core SDK comes with more control over the modal itself, application-embedded popups rather than redirects, and so on.
